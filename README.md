# How to use this repository

Take a look at the tags (`git tag -n1` or using the "Branch" selector if you're
looking at this on github), there is one for each step. The tags are a
combination of `section-prefix` and `step-number`.

To start following along with exercises, clone & checkout step-0:
```
git clone git@github.com:Sequoia/midwestjs-exercises.git
git checkout step-0
```

To jump to, for example, step 2 in the node-core exercises, run the following:

```
git stash # to stash any current changes you may have made
git checkout core-2
```

## FAQ
:question: Do I have to follow along with these tags/steps?

:point_right: No you do not! These are just here in case you get stuck & want to
jump back to a working version, or if you want to compare with the "official"
solutions
